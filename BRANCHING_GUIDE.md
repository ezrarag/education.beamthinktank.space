# Git Branching Strategy for Multi-Agent Development

## 🎯 **Current Setup**

You now have **3 branches** set up:
- `main` - Production branch (stable code)
- `feature/dropdown-menu` - For dropdown menu improvements
- `feature/header-improvements` - For header enhancements

## 🚀 **How to Work with Two Agents**

### **Agent 1 - Dropdown Menu Work**
```bash
# Switch to dropdown branch
git checkout feature/dropdown-menu

# Make your changes to dropdown components
# ... work on dropdown menu ...

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Improve dropdown menu functionality"

# Push to remote (creates the branch on GitHub)
git push origin feature/dropdown-menu
```

### **Agent 2 - Header Improvements**
```bash
# Switch to header branch
git checkout feature/header-improvements

# Make your changes to header components
# ... work on header improvements ...

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Enhance header design and functionality"

# Push to remote (creates the branch on GitHub)
git push origin feature/header-improvements
```

## 🔄 **Merging Work Back to Main**

### **Option 1: Merge Both Branches**
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge dropdown branch
git merge feature/dropdown-menu

# Merge header branch
git merge feature/header-improvements

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### **Option 2: Create Pull Requests (Recommended)**
1. Push both branches to GitHub
2. Create Pull Requests on GitHub for each branch
3. Review and merge through GitHub interface
4. This provides better code review and conflict resolution

## 🛠 **Essential Commands**

### **Check Current Branch**
```bash
git branch
# Shows all local branches, current branch marked with *
```

### **Switch Between Branches**
```bash
git checkout feature/dropdown-menu
git checkout feature/header-improvements
git checkout main
```

### **See All Branches**
```bash
git branch -a
# Shows local and remote branches
```

### **Create New Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

### **Delete Branch (after merging)**
```bash
git branch -d feature/dropdown-menu
git push origin --delete feature/dropdown-menu
```

## ⚠️ **Important Rules**

1. **Never work directly on `main`** - Always use feature branches
2. **Pull before pushing** - `git pull origin main` to get latest changes
3. **Commit frequently** - Small, logical commits are better
4. **Use descriptive commit messages** - Explain what you changed
5. **Test before merging** - Make sure your changes work

## 🔧 **Conflict Resolution**

If you get merge conflicts:
```bash
# Git will show you which files have conflicts
git status

# Edit the conflicted files manually
# Look for <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, and >>>>>>> markers

# After resolving conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

## 📋 **Workflow Summary**

1. **Agent 1**: Work on `feature/dropdown-menu`
2. **Agent 2**: Work on `feature/header-improvements`
3. **Both agents**: Push their branches to GitHub
4. **Review**: Create Pull Requests and review code
5. **Merge**: Merge both branches into `main`
6. **Cleanup**: Delete feature branches after successful merge

## 🎯 **Current Status**

- ✅ Main branch is stable
- ✅ Dropdown menu branch created
- ✅ Header improvements branch created
- ✅ Both agents can work independently
- ⚠️ Need to resolve Git push issues (SSL errors)

## 🚨 **Git Push Issues**

The SSL errors you're seeing are network-related. Try:
1. Different network connection
2. GitHub Desktop instead of command line
3. GitHub CLI: `gh repo sync`
4. Contact GitHub support if persistent
